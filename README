= PHP Audible API =

- Purpose -
Provide a PHP API that can gather audio book data from an audible users account.

I have no intention, at this time, of doing anything more than read-only data-mining operations.



- Install -
All of the files are meant to live in a directory call "Audible".
Create this directory somewhere in the php include path, and then add all the files.



- Dependancies -
PHP 5.0+
Curl
