= PHP Audible API =

- GIT Apology -
This is my first experience with git, so forgive me if I'm doing things all wrong.

- Purpose -
Create a PHP API that can gather audio book data from an audible users account.  

I have no intention, at this time, of doing anything more than read-only data-mining operations.

- Completed -
* Sign-in
* Retrieve a list of all audio books in "My Library"

- TODO -
* Complete the AudioBook class so that it can be initialized with ALL data available from the product view page.
* Retrieve a list of all audio books in "My Next Listen"
* Retrieve a list of all audio books in "Wish List"
